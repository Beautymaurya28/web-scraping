# Web Scraping Project using Python

##  Project Overview

This is a beginner-friendly web scraping project built with Python. The main goal is to extract structured information from websites using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. The extracted data is saved in a clean CSV format for further analysis or use.

This project demonstrates how data can be gathered from public sources in an automated way — a useful skill for data analysis, dashboards, and real-world applications.
